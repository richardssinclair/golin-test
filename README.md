# Setup instructions:

```
npm install && npm run build
```
```
open dist/index.html
```

# Approach:

I used Bootstrap because it is a framework I am familiar with and I know I could get the template up quickly. I decided to use jQuery just to practice my skills and recap how to use it.

I haven't used Webpack before but I followed this tutorial to setup Web-pack with Bootstrap 4 to get me started.

I haven't had much experience of making validation so i used this video to learn how to do it.
